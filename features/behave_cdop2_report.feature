Feature: End to end usage scenario that fulfills report requirements

    As discussed with Anke, the phase 01 (that is terminated prematurely)
    should include the following parts:

    1)  Describe architecture in some detail: short overview of CIS and
        relevant Pytroll modules. Overview of functionalities needed and workflow,
        and what components to take from which package.

        Overview what we identified as open issues, and improvements needed.
        If we identified what to do about it at our meeting in Norrk√∂ping state
        that as well.

    2) Use case of SEVIRI-Polar-Caliop collocation and statistics.
       Example plots. Cookbook on how to do this.
